Forget about a moment of release.
It’ll get better... with Full-mindness surrender.

Bills, bills, bills — they love to stack.
Spoons for days, but a knife you lack.
No WiFi, no signal, now that’s a delight.
Lost power, cold night — but hey — candlelight! 

Breathe in the chaos, exhale with flair. (Breathe)
You’re way out of control — but at least you're aware.
Life’s a spinning class — on a bike with no seat.
Don’t chase the calm—just keep movin’ your feet.
Breathe Breathe Breathe

Close your eyes — your thoughts wave hello. (Hiiieii)
They’re not clouds, they’re a storm.
They’re not seeking freedom — they’re moving in.
Accept them or not, they bought a karaoke machine.
Full-mindness is when you say: Fine. Chaos, whatever.

Breathe in the chaos, exhale with flair. (Breathe)
You’re way out of control — but not out of air.
Life’s a drivin' test — on repeat — down Elm Street.
Don’t chase the calm — be cute in the backseat.  
Breathe Breathe Breathe

Being present isn't simple, it's tense. (Ha!)
Are you Dumbledore — chanting for defense?
Embrace the noise, the now is gone. (now is gone.)
Floor is lava — keep dancing on. (and on and on )

Repeat after me:
Pressure… is the rhythm.
Anxiety… is the beat.

Breathe in the chaos, exhale with flair. (Breathe)
You’re way out of control — but act like you care.
Life’s a marathon — summer heat — shade’s obsolete.
Don’t chase the calm — meet the anthem of incomp—
Breathe Breathe Breathe

You’re doing… not great. But doing it fabulously.
You serve meltdown like it’s Prada.
Namastay… in Mayhem.
