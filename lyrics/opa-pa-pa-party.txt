There ain't no party like an...
opa pa pa pa party

Seismos Through My Body
Music In My Cup
Spinning Like My Blood’s Bacardi
Opa’s Lifting Up
dancers doing what they do
hands up in the air!
energy is everywhere
plans are… (pause) i don't care!

opa! the beat is rising
opa! the lights go wild
opa! everybody to the dancefloor
(opa pa pa party)

there ain’t no party like an
opa pa pa pa party
with all your party pi pi pi–
pi pi people.
you gonna opa hop hop hop hop.
on tables top top top top.
pop the bottle pop pop pop pop.
opa party never stop!

opa says hands in the air and scream opa! (opa!)
opa says spin like a plate and scream opa! (opa!)
opa says stomp that ground and scream opa! (opa!)
opa says: "somebody bring me a tzatziki shot and a dance circle!"

voices getting louder
hearts begin to race
rhythms take us higher
all across this place
legends in the making
feet that never rest
wisdom in the laughter
celebrate the best!
(opa the bouzouki!)

opa! the glow is brighter
opa! the night is young
opa! the joy is rising
(pi pi pi people )

there ain’t no party like an
opa pa pa pa party
with all your party pi pi pi–
you gonna hop higher hop hop hop.
fill drinks top top top top.
sweat drips, drip drip, drip drop
opa party never stop!

hop to the right, hop to the left
both hands lifting the roof – shout opa!
hip to the right, hip to the left
smash imaginary plates – shout opa!
finger point to the sky
point to someone who isn't dancing
point to the floor – shout opa!

catch your breath 
drink some water 
wipe the sweat
don't sit down
it’s gonna hurt tomorrow
stretch your legs
drink some more water
ok, break is over
we’re not done though!

opa says they said on the news jumping makes your life longer!
call your boss! tell them you're not coming to work tomorrow! 
school is canceled! opa will write you a note for the teacher!
no one's going to sleep toniiiiiight!
(sleep is for the weak! )

there ain’t no party like an
opa pa pa pa pa party
with jumpy happy pi pi pi–
pi pi people.
song’s about to swap swap swap.
one last opa hop hop hop.
confetti plop plop plop plop.
opa party top, mic drop.

opa pa pa pa party
there ain't no party like an...
opa pa pa pa party


sunrise through the window
music in my cup
