Back then, you'd meet at the store,
Same town, street, building, or next door.
You'd wait phone-bound, wired to the wall,
For stood-up dates, landlines took fall.

New flakes need no reason at all,
They're home TikTok screening your call.
Swipe left, left, left, swiped right checkmate.
Roomba knock-off is your date.

We want more "Hi", less quick pic texts
More summer lovin', less winter mess.
More moonlight dance, less bot-romance!

Old love story, are you dead?
Now we cherish what we had.
When love was a full baseball game.
Not start home run, then ask for name.
Oh love story, make us feel real.
Not deep-fake love, not faking feel.
Break hearts, mend, ignite and repeat.
Rhythm of love — bring back the beat.
(beat beat beat beat)

Old love, that stomach butterfly,
Time dragged apart, then blinked close by.
You'd ask for a name, then a dance,
Years passed, one hand — oh sweet romance.

New fast food love —  wham bam thanks bye.
"My cat — cry face" — sell fishy lie.
Promiscuous prox-imity apps,
Replacing love with swiping traps.

More dirty dance, less rat race.
More Patrick Swayze, less ghost-chase!
More dance lifts, less falls from grace!

Old love story, are you dead?
Now we cherish what we had.
When love was a full baseball game.
Not start home run, then ask for name.
Oh love story, make us feel real.
Not deep-fake love, not faking feel.
Break hearts, mend, ignite and repeat.
Rhythm of love —  bring back the beeeeeeeat.

Ghosting had charm unlike today,
Swayze-back-hug spinning wet clay.
Arms spread on deck—before jack drawn
My heart'll go on yelled Miss Dion
Must’ve been love with a Roxette track,
Call-girl Roberts, still no big mistake.
Brokeback Mountain — one tent and hay!
Or fifty shady play, called gray 
Whitney sang to her body boo,
And I… I-I-I-I-I will… Always love… youuuuu

Old love story take us way back
Before junk feed turned love to snack
Real love story with flaws and soul,
No bot can fake you — steal your role.
Warm love story, melt hearts forlorn,
Netflix-chill without you — just popcorn.
Old love story — none can compete
Please come back — our heart needs your beat.
